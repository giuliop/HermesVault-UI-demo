# [Hermes Vault](https://github.com/giuliop/HermesVault)
This is the frontend code for HermesVault, an application for private transaction on the Algorand blockchain.  
Access it [hermesvault.org](https://hermesvault.org)


## How to use

### Deposits

Deposits can be accesses from the `Deposit` tab.

Click the `Connect Wallet` button if your wallet is not connected already, at the moment only [Pera](https://perawallet.app/) wallet is supported. You will need to set Pera to use TestNet (by default it uses MainNet), by going `Settings -> Developer Settings -> Node Settings -> TestNet`

Once connected, you'll see your connected address in `From` field. If you need to get algo tokens in your account you can visit the [TestNet Dispenser](https://bank.testnet.algorand.network/). Type in the amount of algo you want to deposit (<u>minimum 1 algo</u>) and press `Deposit`.

A confirmation screen will appear with the secret note <b>THAT YOU MUST SAVE</b> to withdraw your tokens in the future. You will have to paste it back in the appropriate section to proceed, to make sure you have copied it.

If you lose that note, nobody will be able to help you retrieve your tokens.

Now click the `Confirm` button and you will be asked to open your Pera wallet and authorize the transaction. Note that the transaction fee will be 0.042 algo since it is a "heavy" transaction group which requires a lot of computation on the AVM to validate the zero knowledge proof involved.

If all goes well, you will get a success confirmation message. Otherwise you will get an error message explaining what went wrong.

### Withdrawals

Withdrawals can be accessed from the `Withdraw` tab.

Fill the `Amount` field with the amount you wish to withdraw, the `Address` field with the address you with to receive the withdrawal, and the `Note` field with the secret note you received when you deposited or made a withdrawal in the past.

The address receiving the tokens is not paying any transaction fee, so it can be a new, zero-balance account.

The deposit you are withdrawing from (identified by your secret note) will be reduced by the amount withdrawn and a protocol fee of 0.1% (with a minimum fee of 0.1 algo).  
What is left will be automatically inserted in the contract as a new deposit with a new secret note that will be shown to you in the next screen.

As with deposits, before the withdrawal transaction takes place, you will be asked to save the new secret note and prove you did by pasting it back in the appropriate section.
Click `Confirm` and if all goes well, you will get a success confirmation message. Otherwise you will get an error message explaining what went wrong.

### Fees
The frontend does not charge any fees.

The protocol does not charge any fee for deposits but the transaction fee needed by the network to process it is 0.042 algo which you will pay.

The protocol charges a 0.1% fee on withdrawals (with a minimum fee of 0.1 algo).  
Of that fee, ~0.1 algo are needed to cover transaction and storage fees, while the rest accrues to the protocol treasury.  
100% of the protocol treasury will be targeted back to the protocol users, details will be published before MainNet.


### Privacy and security

While the HermesVault smart contracts are fully permissionless and decentralized, this frontend is a hosted website and a centralized entity, so it is subject to the laws and regulations of the jurisdiction it operates in.

For that purpose, the frontend stores receipts that could be used to link back specific withdrawals to the original deposits if so compelled by law enforcement.

In any case, the frontend can NEVER access users' funds, which are always 100% controlled by the users only.

There are two ways you can lose your funds:
1) You lose your secret note
2) The frontend is hacked and it serves you malicious code to steal your secret note
